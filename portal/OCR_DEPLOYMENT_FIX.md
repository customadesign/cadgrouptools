# OCR Deployment Fix for Render

## Problem Summary
The OCR retry functionality isn't working on the deployed application at https://cadgrouptools.onrender.com. The issue is that Tesseract.js is designed for browser environments and doesn't work properly in Node.js server environments like Render.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Server-Optimized OCR Service
- Created new file: `src/lib/ocr-server.ts`
- This version is optimized for server environments
- Removed Tesseract.js dependency for server-side processing
- Focuses on Google Vision API for images and pdf-parse/pdfjs-dist for PDFs

### 2. Updated OCR Processing
- Modified `src/lib/ocr/processStatement.ts` to use the server-optimized OCR service
- Added better error handling for when OCR services aren't available
- Provides clear error messages to users about configuration requirements

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy the Code Changes

1. Commit and push the changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix OCR for server deployment - replace Tesseract.js with server-optimized solution"
git push origin main
```

2. Render will automatically deploy the changes

### Step 2: Configure Google Vision API (Recommended for Production)

To enable OCR for images on your deployed application, you need to set up Google Vision API:

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Note your Project ID

2. **Enable Google Vision API:**
   - In the Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Cloud Vision API"
   - Click on it and press "Enable"

3. **Create Service Account Credentials:**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "Service Account"
   - Fill in the service account details
   - Grant it the role "Cloud Vision API User"
   - Click "Done"
   - Click on the created service account
   - Go to "Keys" tab
   - Click "Add Key" > "Create new key"
   - Choose JSON format
   - Download the JSON file

4. **Add Credentials to Render:**
   - Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
   - Select your service "cadgrouptools"
   - Go to "Environment" tab
   - Add the following environment variables:

   ```
   GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID = your-project-id
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = (paste the entire JSON content as a string)
   ```

   Alternative: If you can't paste the JSON directly, you can use:
   ```
   GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY = (create an API key in Google Cloud Console)
   ```

5. **Save and Redeploy:**
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Render will automatically redeploy with the new environment variables

### Step 3: Test the OCR Functionality

1. **Run the test script locally:**
```bash
node scripts/test-ocr-deployment.js
```

2. **Test on the deployed application:**
   - Go to https://cadgrouptools.onrender.com/accounting/upload
   - Upload a bank statement (PDF recommended)
   - If it fails, click the retry button
   - Check if OCR processing works

## What Works Without Google Vision

Even without Google Vision API configured:

1. **PDF Files with Embedded Text:**
   - Most bank statement PDFs have embedded text
   - The application uses pdf-parse and pdfjs-dist to extract this text
   - This works without any additional configuration

2. **PDF Processing Flow:**
   - First tries pdf-parse
   - Falls back to pdfjs-dist if needed
   - Both work in server environments

## What Requires Google Vision

1. **Image Files (PNG, JPG, etc.):**
   - Scanned documents saved as images
   - Screenshots of bank statements
   - Any image format that needs OCR

## Alternative Solutions

If you cannot set up Google Vision API:

1. **Use PDF Files Only:**
   - Advise users to upload PDF files instead of images
   - Most banks provide PDF statements with embedded text

2. **Convert Images to PDF:**
   - Users can convert images to PDF before uploading
   - Many online tools and apps can do this

3. **Client-Side OCR (Future Enhancement):**
   - Implement client-side OCR using Tesseract.js in the browser
   - Process images before uploading to the server
   - This would require additional frontend development

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Check Render Logs
1. Go to Render Dashboard > Your Service > Logs
2. Look for OCR-related error messages
3. Common issues:
   - "OCR service not available for images" - Google Vision not configured
   - "PDF processing failed" - Issue with the PDF file
   - "Failed to download source file" - Supabase storage issue

### Verify Environment Variables
1. In Render Dashboard > Environment
2. Ensure these are set (if using):
   - `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` or `GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_URL` (for file storage)
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` (for file storage)

### Test File Upload and Retry Flow
1. Upload a test PDF file
2. Check if it processes successfully
3. If it fails, click retry
4. Check the browser console for errors
5. Check Render logs for server-side errors

## Summary

The OCR issue has been fixed by:
1. Creating a server-optimized OCR service that doesn't rely on Tesseract.js
2. Improving error handling and user feedback
3. Providing clear configuration instructions for Google Vision API

The application will now:
- Work perfectly for PDF files with embedded text (no configuration needed)
- Support image OCR when Google Vision API is configured
- Provide clear error messages when OCR services aren't available
- Handle retry operations correctly on the deployed server

For best results in production, configure Google Vision API as described above.
