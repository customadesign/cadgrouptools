## Required Environment Variables for Supabase Integration

### Critical Variables to Set in Render Dashboard

Please verify/add these environment variables in your Render dashboard:
1. Navigate to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select your "cadgrouptools" service
3. Go to "Environment" tab
4. Add/verify these variables:

#### Supabase Configuration (REQUIRED for avatar uploads)
```
SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-project-url>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=<your-supabase-service-role-key>
SUPABASE_BUCKET=cadgroup-uploads
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<same-as-SUPABASE_URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
```

### How to Get These Values
1. **Log into Supabase Dashboard**: https://app.supabase.com
2. **Select your project** or create a new one
3. **Go to Settings > API**:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`: Copy the "Project URL"
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE`: Copy the "service_role" key (under Project API keys)
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Copy the "anon" key (under Project API keys)
4. **Go to Storage**:
   - Create a bucket named `cadgroup-uploads` if it doesn't exist
   - Set the bucket to public or configure RLS policies as needed

### Existing Environment Variables (Already Set)
Based on the application requirements, these should already be configured:
- `MONGODB_URI` - MongoDB connection string
- `DB_NAME` - Database name (cadtools)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Should be: https://cadgrouptools.onrender.com
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Authentication secret
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - Email service
- `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` - noreply@tools.cadgroupmgt.com
- `S3_*` variables - For file storage

## Features Deployed

### Client Management Enhancements
1. **Avatar/Profile Picture Support**
   - New endpoint: `/api/clients/[id]/avatar`
   - Supabase storage integration
   - Image upload and display functionality

2. **Real Data Integration**
   - All client pages now fetch real data from MongoDB
   - Removed mock data (no more "John Smith" placeholder)
   - Full CRUD operations working

3. **Enhanced Client Model**
   - Added avatar field
   - Additional contact fields
   - Better data structure

4. **Updated Pages**
   - `/clients` - List view with real data
   - `/clients/[id]` - Detail view with avatar display
   - `/clients/[id]/edit` - Edit form with all fields
   - `/clients/new` - Creation form with validation

## Testing the Deployment

### Quick Tests
1. **Check Health**: 
   ```bash
   curl https://cadgrouptools.onrender.com/api/health/db
   ```

2. **Test Client API** (requires authentication):
   - List clients: GET `/api/clients`
   - Get client: GET `/api/clients/{id}`
   - Create client: POST `/api/clients`
   - Update client: PUT `/api/clients/{id}`
   - Upload avatar: POST `/api/clients/{id}/avatar`

### Manual Testing
1. Sign in to the application
2. Navigate to Clients section
3. Create a new client with all fields
4. Upload a profile picture
5. Edit existing client information
6. Verify all data persists correctly

## Troubleshooting

### If Avatar Uploads Fail
1. Check Supabase environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify the `cadgroup-uploads` bucket exists in Supabase
3. Check bucket permissions (should allow uploads)
4. Review Render logs for specific error messages

### If Client Data Doesn't Load
1. Verify MongoDB connection is working
2. Check MONGODB_URI environment variable
3. Review API response in browser DevTools
4. Check Render logs for database connection errors

### Viewing Logs
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Select your service
3. Click on "Logs" tab
4. Look for any error messages

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Verify all environment variables are set in Render
2. ✅ Test the client functionality end-to-end
3. ✅ Confirm avatar uploads work with Supabase
4. ✅ Monitor logs for any issues
5. ✅ Set up monitoring/alerts if needed

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Render logs first
2. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure Supabase bucket exists and has proper permissions
4. Test API endpoints individually to isolate issues
