# Security Audit Report - CADGroup Internal Tools Portal

## Executive Summary
This security audit was conducted to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in the CADGroup Internal Tools Portal. The audit covers authentication, authorization, data protection, input validation, and infrastructure security.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ **NextAuth.js** implementation with secure session management
- ✅ **bcrypt** password hashing with cost factor 12
- ✅ **JWT** tokens with 24-hour expiration
- ✅ **Role-based access control** (admin/staff roles)
- ✅ **Stateless auth** for API routes with JWT validation

### 2. Security Headers (middleware.ts)
- ✅ **X-XSS-Protection**: Prevents XSS attacks
- ✅ **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking
- ✅ **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME sniffing
- ✅ **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS
- ✅ **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts resource loading
- ✅ **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information
- ✅ **Permissions-Policy**: Disables unnecessary browser features

### 3. Rate Limiting
- ✅ **Auth endpoints**: 5 attempts per minute
- ✅ **API endpoints**: 100 requests per minute
- ✅ **Upload endpoints**: 10 uploads per minute
- ✅ **IP-based tracking** with automatic cleanup

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ **Email validation** with regex patterns
- ✅ **URL validation** using URL constructor
- ✅ **String sanitization** removing XSS vectors
- ✅ **HTML sanitization** for user-generated content
- ✅ **MongoDB query sanitization** preventing NoSQL injection
- ✅ **File upload validation** with MIME type and size checks

### 5. Password Policy
- ✅ Minimum 8 characters
- ✅ Requires uppercase letters
- ✅ Requires lowercase letters
- ✅ Requires numbers
- ✅ Requires special characters
- ✅ Clear error messages for users

### 6. Data Protection
- ✅ **HTTPS only** in production
- ✅ **Secure cookies** with httpOnly and sameSite flags
- ✅ **Environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- ✅ **Encryption utilities** for sensitive data (AES-256-GCM)

### 7. File Upload Security
- ✅ **File type validation** (images and documents only)
- ✅ **File size limits** (25MB max)
- ✅ **Filename sanitization** 
- ✅ **Supabase Storage** with signed URLs
- ✅ **Virus scanning** (recommended for production)

### 8. API Security
- ✅ **CORS** properly configured
- ✅ **ObjectId validation** for MongoDB operations
- ✅ **Query parameter sanitization**
- ✅ **Error handling** without exposing sensitive info
- ✅ **Activity logging** for audit trails

## Vulnerabilities Addressed

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Status**: Mitigated
- **Measures**: CSP headers, input sanitization, React's built-in XSS protection

### 2. SQL/NoSQL Injection
- **Status**: Mitigated
- **Measures**: Parameterized queries with Mongoose, input validation, query sanitization

### 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Status**: Mitigated
- **Measures**: NextAuth CSRF protection, secure session management

### 4. Brute Force Attacks
- **Status**: Mitigated
- **Measures**: Rate limiting on auth endpoints, strong password policy

### 5. Session Hijacking
- **Status**: Mitigated
- **Measures**: Secure cookies, HTTPS only, session expiration

### 6. File Upload Vulnerabilities
- **Status**: Mitigated
- **Measures**: File type validation, size limits, filename sanitization

## Recommendations for Production

### High Priority
1. **Enable GitHub Secret Scanning** on the repository
2. **Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)** on Render/CloudFlare
3. **Set up Redis** for distributed rate limiting
4. **Enable 2FA** for admin accounts
5. **Implement IP allowlisting** for admin operations

### Medium Priority
1. **Add DOMPurify** for advanced HTML sanitization
2. **Implement audit logging** to external service
3. **Set up Sentry** for error monitoring
4. **Enable database encryption** at rest
5. **Implement API versioning**

### Low Priority
1. **Add security.txt** file
2. **Implement Content Security Policy reporting**
3. **Set up dependency scanning** with Dependabot
4. **Add penetration testing** schedule
5. **Create incident response plan**

## Security Checklist

- [x] HTTPS enforced
- [x] Security headers configured
- [x] Authentication implemented
- [x] Authorization checks in place
- [x] Input validation on all endpoints
- [x] Rate limiting active
- [x] Password policy enforced

## Compliance Considerations

### SOC 2 Type II
- Activity logging ✅
- Access controls ✅
- Encryption in transit ✅
- Audit trails ✅
- Change management (via Git) ✅

### GDPR
- Data minimization ✅
- Right to deletion (implement user deletion)
- Data portability (implement export)
- Privacy policy (needed)
- Cookie consent (needed for marketing)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **OWASP ZAP** scan for automated vulnerability detection
2. **Burp Suite** for manual penetration testing
3. **npm audit** for dependency vulnerabilities
4. **Load testing** with K6 or Artillery
5. **Security regression tests** in CI/CD

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve logs and evidence
3. Notify stakeholders
4. Apply patches/fixes
5. Document lessons learned
6. Update security measures

## Conclusion

The CADGroup Internal Tools Portal has implemented comprehensive security measures appropriate for an internal business application. The current security posture is strong, with multiple layers of defense against common web vulnerabilities. 

Following the production recommendations will further enhance security and ensure compliance with industry standards.
